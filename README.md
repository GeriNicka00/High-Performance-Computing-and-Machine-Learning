# High-Performance-Computing-and-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning algorithms for image recognition which where tested for performance on BlueCrystal4, the University of Bristol supercomputer.

Benchmarking of deep learning was performed as part of my internship.

A report on the best practices to increase performace is available.
